<h1>Skeleton</h1> 
<h3>A Beautiful Boilerplate for Responsive, Mobile-Friendly Development</h3>
<p><strong>This is a small collection of CSS & JS files that can help you rapidly develop sites that look beautiful at any size, be it a 17" laptop screen or an iPhone.</strong></p>

<p>Check out the docs and homepage here: <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com">www.getskeleton.com</a>.</p>

<p>Skeleton is built on three core principles:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Responsive Grid Down To Mobile</strong>: Skeleton has a familiar, lightweight 960 grid as it's base, but elegantly scales down to downsized browser windows, tablets, mobile phones (in landscape and portrait)</li>
	<li><strong>Fast to Start</strong>: Skeleton is a tool for rapid development. Get started fast with CSS best practices, a well-structured grid that makes mobile consideration easy, an organized file structure and super basic UI elements like lightly styled forms, buttons, tabs and more.</li>
	<li><strong>Style Agnostic</strong>: Skeleton is not a UI framework. It's a development kit that provides the most basic styles as a foundation, but is ready to adopt whatever your design or style is.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The ultimate goal</strong> is to build the best starting point for front-end development with an emphasis on simple, responsive design. Help me get there by submitting bugs, feature suggestions or anything you think is missing here on Github or email me at hi@getskeleton.com. <strong>I'm committed to making this awesome, so please use this in your next project and let me know what rocked and what sucked!</strong></p>
